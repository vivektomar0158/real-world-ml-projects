## Conclusion

In this project, I aimed to predict the presence of heart disease using a dataset  
containing various clinical features.

After importing and exploring the data, I analyzed patterns in the target variable  
and visualized key features to better understand the relationships within the dataset.  
This helped in identifying potential indicators of heart disease.

I implemented and evaluated several machine learning models using scikit-learn,  
including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.  
These models were assessed using standard classification metrics such as accuracy,  
precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

Logistic Regression performed particularly well, offering a strong balance between  
accuracy and interpretability. Random Forest also delivered solid performance,  
serving as a reliable baseline with good generalization capabilities.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can support the early detection  
of heart disease using basic clinical inputs.  

With further model tuning, the inclusion of more diverse data, or the application  
of advanced algorithms, the predictive power could be enhancedâ€”potentially contributing  
to real-world healthcare decisions.
