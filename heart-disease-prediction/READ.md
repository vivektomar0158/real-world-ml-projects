# Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on clinical features such as age, cholesterol level, chest pain type, and resting blood pressure. The dataset is based on the well-known Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.

## What I Did
- Performed data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Handled categorical features with encoding and scaled numerical variables
- Trained and evaluated multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, and Random Forest
- Compared model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Identified key features influencing heart disease, such as chest pain type and maximum heart rate

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (classification models, metrics, preprocessing)
