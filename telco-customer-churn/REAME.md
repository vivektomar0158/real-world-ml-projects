# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn (i.e., leave the service) based on customer demographics, account information, and service usage. Itâ€™s a classification problem with real business impact, often used by companies to improve customer retention.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset (handled missing values and encoded categorical variables)
- Performed exploratory data analysis (churn distribution, tenure, contract type, etc.)
- Trained and evaluated multiple classification models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance
- Identified key factors influencing churn, such as contract type and payment method

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (classification models, metrics)
