#  Bulldozer Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the sale price of used bulldozers based on historical auction data. The dataset comes from a Kaggle competition and includes various features such as equipment type, year made, usage, and sale date.

## What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset (handled missing values, parsed dates)
- Extracted and engineered features from timestamps and categorical columns
- Trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict bulldozer prices
- Evaluated model performance using R² and RMSLE
- Analyzed feature importance and discussed potential model improvements

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor, model evaluation)

## File
- `end-to-end-bulldozer-price-project.ipynb` — full notebook with code and results
