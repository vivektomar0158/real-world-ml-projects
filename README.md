## Real-World Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to my collection of end-to-end machine learning projects! Each project in this repository is based on real-world datasets and explores practical problems across different industries ‚Äî from healthcare to business and equipment sales. These projects demonstrate my ability to clean data, engineer features, train and evaluate models, and communicate results clearly.

### Projects Overview
## 1. Heart Disease Prediction
Goal: Predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical features like age, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and more.

## What I did:

Performed exploratory data analysis and visualization
Preprocessed data and handled categorical variables
Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models
Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Identified most impactful features for prediction
üîß Tools: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## 2. Bulldozer Price Prediction
Goal: Predict the sale price of used bulldozers at auction using historical sales data.

### What I did:

Parsed and extracted date features from sales timestamps
Engineered useful features from product IDs and categories
Trained a Random Forest Regressor on tabular data
Evaluated model performance using R¬≤ score and RMSLE
Discussed potential for model improvement with advanced tuning or boosting
üîß Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## 3. Telco Customer Churn Prediction
Goal: Predict whether a telecom customer will churn based on demographics and service usage.

### What I did:

Cleaned and encoded categorical variables (e.g. contract type, payment method)
Visualized churn trends by feature (e.g. tenure, contract length)
Trained and compared classification models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest
Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Interpreted feature importance and business impact of churn indicators
üîß Tools: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

### Overview
These projects are more than tutorials ‚Äî they represent hands-on, end-to-end pipelines. From messy raw data to actionable predictions, I‚Äôve worked through real-world challenges and delivered interpretable machine learning models. Thanks for checking out my work! ‚≠ê Feel free to explore each project folder to see the notebooks in detail.
